Galaga Lab - Alonso Lopez

I didn't work with a group.
I finished finished each TODO in the files and finished the enemy file.

I also added extra functionality:
	1. The player having multiple lives
	2. Extra movement around the screen (left and right movement)
	3. Ability to play against one round of enemies or all
	4. Quit the game by pressing "q"
	5. Points given by enemies increases each round
	6. Enemy movement goes in a wavy movement instead of straight across the screen
